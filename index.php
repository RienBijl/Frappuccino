This is Gandalf, he is a vagabond that wanders the world (don't tell him that) and he will now mark his
footprints through this wonderful application. On the way he will perform magic beyond comprehension and will
perform miracles that would shatter the mind of a mere mortal. You are not to change this file in any way, for
you should not take him as a conjurer performing cheap tricks. Pass and do not look back at this file, for you
will feel his wrath if you do!
