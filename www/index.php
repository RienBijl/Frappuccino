This is Gandalf, he is a vagabond that wanders the world (don't tell him that) and he will now mark his
footprints through this wonderful application. On the way he will perform magic beyond comprehension and will
perform miracles that would shatter the mind of a mere mortal. Best not to mess with this file, or he will be
very upset!
